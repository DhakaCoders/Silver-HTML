                  <blockquote>This Extra Strength Silver Gel is the best! I already re ordered it! My husband had a wound that wasn’t healing for a long time, then I found this gel here. It had great reviews, so we thought maybe it will help.  I could not believe how fast it healed! Pretty much after three days the wound didn’t have any swelling and stopped leaking completely ( it leaked some brown fluid before)!</blockquote>

This gel prevented an infection it prevented excess drainage and the best part is cat never licked it off, it is so lightweight he din not know it was on him. Thank you for a great product.</blockquote>

                  <blockquote>I used this product to help heal a 6 month old bleeding ulcer on my skin. After cleaning the spot with saline solution I added a dab of this to a non-stick pad and covered the wound. After several days of doing this it stopped oozing yellowish green discharge. Now I am just cleaning the spot with  saline and putting a non-stick pad on it and it is healing  just fine now. I owe it all to this gel. I recommend this product to all of my friends and family.</blockquote>

I waz searching for something to help heal the blisters that appear  around my mouth and on my lips if I am out in the sun for too long  or if I am stressing out over whatever it is that I stress out over… Typically it takes  a couple of weeks – or more to heal them up. Not to mention the pain, burning, cracking. And the array of creams, ointments, etc that I have used to help heal them is over the top.</blockquote>

For 2 weeks I have been applying the silver gel to his gums as well as having him drink the liquid. I’ve noticed a difference in his breath(it was so bad) as well he’s  getting playful again and acting like a puppy.
